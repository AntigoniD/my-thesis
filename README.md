## Machine Learning Systems in Hotel Reservations using in particular the XGBoost algorithm

### 1. Abstract 

This thesis is entitled "Machine Learning Systems in Hotel Reservations" and analyses the problem of hotel reservation cancellations using machine learning, in particular the XGBoost algorithm.

Online booking platforms for hotels have brought about significant changes in the way customers make reservations and in their behavior. Many bookings are cancelled due to change of plans or various schedules. The question that arises is this: "Can we predict whether a customer will keep their reservation or cancel it?"

The study uses a dataset from Kaggle.com with real data from hotels. For better understanding, exploratory analysis of the data is performed with visualizations and charts using Python. In the data pre-processing stage, new independent variables are added to optimize the analysis.

An XGBoost predictive model is created, which belongs to the machine learning library of gradient-boosted decision trees, known as gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT). The dataset is divided into training data and test data, and the cross-validation technique helps in better data sharing. Grid Search is also applied to adjust the hyperparameters.

To evaluate the model, the ROC and AUC curves and the SHAP library are used for greater transparency of the factors that influenced the optimization of the model.
Machine learning is a tool, which can be very useful and profitable in the tourism sector.
